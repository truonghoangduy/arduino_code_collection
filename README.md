# arduino_code_collection
My source code through a month of Arduino experiment

Those are simple, small projects written for Arduino playground in some sections. Just some projects are really invested more effort than others, like 315Mhz communication, G29 Shifter modification, and Joystick Mouse.

Most are tested on ATmega328P and burned into ATTiny85 for cheaper, smaller solution.

You are free to take all source code samples into your project, credit me if you like, also I won't be responsible for any problems you may encounter on using it ;)

ENJOY !
